I am a Manager of Analytics Engineering and Tableau DataDev Ambassador with experience in data warehousing and Tableau dashboard development as well as using APIs to automate Tableau Server administration. With this blog, I’m hoping to share some of my experiences and learnings so others can benefit and grow as well.
